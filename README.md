# **Aerarium - A basic Python-based Tax Calculator**
## **Description**
Aerarium is a small program that allows a user to provide a few details relating to their salary and tax status and then calculates and outputs a summary of expected deducations. These are based on accurate Irish 21/22 rates and return values consistent with other such calculators available on the web. 

The program allows a user to save their calculations for retrieval at a later date, using a log-in process. 

The application was named after the term which describes the ancient Roman treasury department, in line with the theme of finances and taxation.

It runs in the terminal window and is deployed to Heroku. 

The live application can be found here: [Aerarium - A basic Python-based Tax Calculator](https://aerarium.herokuapp.com/)
