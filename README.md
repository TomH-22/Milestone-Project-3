# **Aerarium - A basic Python-based Tax Calculator**
## **Description**
Aerarium is a small program that allows a user to provide a few details relating to their salary and tax status and then calculates and outputs a summary of expected deducations. These are based on accurate Irish 21/22 rates and return values consistent with other such calculators available on the web. 

The program allows a user to save their calculations for retrieval at a later date, using a log-in process. 

The application was named after the term which describes the ancient Roman treasury department, in line with the theme of finances and taxation.

It runs in the terminal window and is deployed to Heroku.

# **Development**
The terminal-based application was developed using Python as the primary languages and an emphasis was placed on an easy-to-use UX design and best practice.

## **Users and Target Audience**

### **Target Audience**
The target audience comprises of people who wish to assess their own earnings in terms of tax liabilities etc: in this sense, it can be a useful tool in budgeting or to quickly determine to what degree a potential change in salary, e.g. through a promotion, would impact the user's financial bottom line.

### **User Stories**
- A **New User** wants to be able to follow the flow through the program in an enjoyable manner, and obtain the expected information in as few steps as possible. They may wish to save their data to access later. They wish to be able to rely on the calculations in terms of accuracy, and so expect the program be up-to-date.

- An **Existing User** might want to revisit the program and access previously saved data in a straight-forward and intuitive manner. They may return in the following year to see, e.g., if changes to the budget would affect their take-home-pay. As a result, it would be expected that the program is regularly updated and that a message confirming up-to-date status is displayed accordingly. 

- An **Admin User** might want to update the program as new taxation rules emerge: this is easily facilitated through intuitive code-comments and clean overall code.
